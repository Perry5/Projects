The projects on here are things that I have worked on either at school, work or on my own. Of course they are 
projects that I can open source without breaking any policies or violating any rules/regulations. If you have any 
questions about any of the projects or code on here, please do reach out to me. I will not make my contact information
available here in order to avoid spamming and creepers from calling or emailing me. If you NEED to reach me, I am sure
you will find a way ;-)

I hope you learn soemthing from these projects I have worked on and I hope you feel free to ask any questions. 

Cheers. 
Perry Ogwuche
